Lix-Alert
=========

A notification and stats tracking system for Elixir wars and other Carnage events held on the online MMORPG NexusTK.  Lix-Alert scrapes NexusTK's public HTML forums and updates with a tweet whenever a new Carnage event is found.  Lix-Alert also scrapes NexusTK user profiles of whitelisted users to track their statistics after each game.  Users are whitelisted by tweeting at the Lix Alert bot with their NexusTK username.  Leaderboards are posted on Twitter and Tumblr weekly and monthly.

This project is poorly documented, and unfinished, and might not work without fennagling.
